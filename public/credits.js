/*
 * credits.js: who made this, who flew it, and whose work it stands on.
 *
 * Built as a DOM tree so the simulator overlay and the public board can
 * share the same roll. The live address is the simulator at #credits.
 * This file is the overlay fallback if that page cannot be reached.
 *
 * WHY EVERY PILOT CARRIES A TICKET. A credits page that only says thank
 * you is a credits page nobody believes, and it reads like it was
 * generated rather than earned. Every line under a pilot's name here is
 * a real entry in PROGRESS.md: the date, what they reported, and what it
 * changed. One of them changed nothing on purpose, and that is written
 * down too, because a report that stops a bad fix is worth as much as
 * one that starts a good one.
 *
 * WHY THE CARD IS THE HIT TARGET BUT THE NAME IS THE LINK. A pilot card
 * is one thing about one person, so a click anywhere on it should land
 * on their channel. Wrapping the whole card in an <a> would make the
 * accessible name of that link the entire card, note and ticket and all,
 * which is a paragraph read out where a name should be. So the heading
 * holds the anchor and the anchor's ::after is stretched over the card.
 * The project cards below could not be wrapped anyway: their copy
 * already carries links, and an <a> inside an <a> is not a document.
 *
 * Marks live in credits/. The four
 * project marks are the official ones: Betaflight's dark wordmark,
 * TrackDraw's dark-background colour mark, Grok's 2025 wordmark,
 * Claude's starburst. The faces are the channels' own pictures, at the
 * size YouTube serves them. All of them are used only to name the work.
